# Javascript Quiz App!
A JavaScript Quiz application, written as the fourth assignment for the bootcamp.  The goal of this assignment was to use intermediate Javascript skills to create
an interactive web application.  This includes handling events, DOM Manipulation, using a browser's local storage, and the ability to navigate and interact with multiple webpages that each have their 
own JS file associated with them.  

# Usage
Browse to spm61.github.io/js-quiz-app to load the application.  A brief set of instructions will be displayed.  Click the Begin Quiz button to start taking the quiz.
Five questions will be presented one at a time.  If you get an answer right, it displays correct and moves on to the next question.  If you get a question wrong,
it will display incorrect and subtracts 10 seconds from the timer. 
The quiz ends when all questions are answered or you run out of time.  Your score is based on the time remaining (or 0 if you ran out of time).  After the quiz
is finished, you can save your score, which will be kept in the browser's local storage.  THe clear button can be used to clear the high scores table.
